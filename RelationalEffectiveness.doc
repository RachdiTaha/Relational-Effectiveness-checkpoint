 Situation 1:
■I think that the best way to deal with this situation is to not over react and not to blame or humiliate my colleague
■I will try not to be overly sensitive about his opening and i accept that not everyone is going to agrees with my ideas
■I need to act confident during my meeting and i don’t need to be derailed by that one unfriendly eye-roller.

The dialogue between me and my colleague. 

■Me: Hi Rajae if you have sometime Can we talk please about what you said? 
■Rajae: Of course. 
■Me: You said that i'm not invested and that I am incompetent in my work and i want to understand why you said that?
■Rajae: I found that you didn’t respect the deadlines in this project and also you didn’t finish all what you were supposed to do.
■Me: Well, my current project deadline has passed and we still have no idea when everything will be finished. It was a really aggressive time estimate from the start. My boss just gave it to me and I said I would try, but I knew it couldn’t be completed in that amount of time. I should have asked for more time and a bigger team.

Situation 2:
■I will explain what I’m working on and why i don’t have the bandwidth for additional work, and I need to be kind but firm. I will Stand my ground and be firm in my boundaries it’s likely she’ll respect me more for it and she will see me are paying attention to priorities.

The dialogue between me and my colleague. 

■Emna: I’m so busy at work and cannot complete my tasks. I hope that you can do one of my work tasks please.
■Me: Thanks for inviting me to work on that project, however, I have this deadline with our CFO and I can't tackle that right now. If you really need my input, I will help you tomorrow good luck.
